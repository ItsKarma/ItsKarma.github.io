### This Website
This website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's a neat tool for writing static websites in markdown. That markdown is then converted to html that can be uploaded to your hosting service.


## Old Skool

I went to school for Animation. My whole life has been around computers so it was easy for me to get a job in IT even without a degree. That has evolved over the years and now I work in automation.


### 2011 Old Website
Here is my old art portfolio website when I was in college. Some of the links are broken and I may make an attempt to correct the at some time.
