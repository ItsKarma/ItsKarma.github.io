This is the place where I share my ideas on technology around the enterprise infrastructure, and maybe some other off topic stuff.  

I don't really want to call this a blog, even though it is set up like one. I just want to share my thoughts and processes on some things. I will have a post about a topic or tool, and as the way I use the tool changes, I will modify them.

I'm not active on social media, I don't have a Facebook, I never really post anything on Twitter. I prefer not to share every moment of my personal life with the internet. Instead I will share information and thoughts about technology so others can learn and maybe I can contribute something to help make a better tomorrow.

That sounded super cheesy, but I just want to help write good useful software.
