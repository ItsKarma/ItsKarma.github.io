I am a Developer/DevOps/SRE/SysAdmin/Father/Friend living in Lehigh Valley, PA.

I started my career in the Enterprise in a physical datacenter. Evolved from Bare metal to Virtualization with VMWare, to Cloud on AWS/EC2, to containers with Docker/ECS/Kubernetes, to Serverless with Lambda.

I currently enjoy growing companies from early stage to exit. Every company/stack is a bit different, but in general I have a system you can find in my [Process](/process/).

In the winter I love to Snowboard, in the summer I skateboard a bit. I am a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Blue Belt and train a few times per week. I also love to play Guitar/Music, anything to express creativity.
