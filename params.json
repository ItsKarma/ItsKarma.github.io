{"name":"ItsKarma","tagline":"My DevOps Stack","body":"### Welcome to Mah Sthack.\r\nThis is an overview of my DevOps stack. The tools I use, and why I use them.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat /etc/issue\r\nMatthew Karmazyn\r\nmatthew.karmazyn@gmail.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n### It all starts with the OS\r\nLinux: I prefer the RHEL family, and me being a free man, I like CentOS.\r\n\r\n### Infrastrucutre, who needs it?\r\nDatacenters are great, but they are a lot of work. Lots of people, lots of space, lots of hardware, power, ups, generators... Scratch all that and go to the cloud. I personally use Amazon Web Services for my cloud computing. They are doing things that your datacenter can't, and probably for less.\r\n\r\n### Packer\r\nPacker stuff.\r\n\r\n### Dev/Test\r\nVagrant\r\nDocker\r\n\r\n### Configuration Management\r\nIn a past life I've used Chef. It was great, and I would totally recommend it.\r\nToday I'm using Ansible. Agentless, uses ssh, it's nice and simple.\r\n\r\n### Continuous\r\nJenkins\r\n\r\n### Automate All The Things!\r\nI'm allergic to doing things twice. Automate all the things!\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\nLogstash - with rsyslog\r\n\r\n### Backup\r\n???","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
