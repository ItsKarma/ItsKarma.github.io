Lots of people, lots of space, lots of hardware, power, ups, generators... Scratch all that and go to the cloud. I personally use Amazon Web Services for my cloud computing. They are doing things that your datacenter doesn't, and probably for less.\r\n\r\n### Packer\r\nUse [Packer](https://packer.io/) to build identical images for multiple platforms. In my case, from the same set of scripts I can build an Amazon Machine Image used for production, and a Docker Container or a Vagrant box for development. Using packer, I can hand my developers a production instance on their local workstations. No more dependency issues, no more \"It works on my laptop, I don't know why it's not working on the QA server.\" \r\n\r\n### Dev/Test\r\nVagrant\r\nDocker\r\n\r\n### Configuration Management\r\n[Chef](http://chef.io) is my tool of choice for configuration management. I also use the chef server as my single source of truth. No need for an inventory system, it's all in chef already. I use knife to query details about my nodes and publish them to an internal site, typically confluence, for all to view.\r\n\r\n### Continuous Integration\r\nJenkins for automated builds and push button deployments.\r\n\r\n### Automate All The Things!\r\nI'm allergic to doing things twice. I like to do something once to understand the process, then the automation begins. I don't actually want to do any work, and I work very hard to make that happen by automating everything. It keeps me busy ;) My scripts and tools are typically written in bash or python depending on the complexity.\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\n[ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack) (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana) with rsyslog forwarding the logs to a central logging server takes the load off the app server. The approach using rsyslog also frees up some memory and cpu cycles on the instance for more important tasks.\r\n\r\n### Backup\r\n???","google":"UA-63777307-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
